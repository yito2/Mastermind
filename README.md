# Mastermind
Mastermind game, Java code for the code breaker, the user being the code maker

This project highlighted the use of creativity and recursive use of Arraylists to create a codebreaker for the game Mastermind. The maximum number of pegs/colors you can use for this particular breaker is 8. The Main.java file runs the GUI content along with the restart option. The Codebreaker.java file holds the “meat” of the codebreaking code. And Choice.java generates the choices that the computer uses to guess the combination of colors that the user inputs. 

The README has the general structure of the assignment and the OUTPUT file shows the printout results of my code. 

Directions:
Code written in Eclipse
Code can be run in Terminal
cd Desktop
gcc Main.java
./a.out
